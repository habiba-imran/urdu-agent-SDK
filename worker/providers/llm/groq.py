"""Groq LLM adapter (Phase 6b, docs/UKASHA_AGENT_FACING_MULTIPLE_PROVIDERS_PLAN.md, ADR-036).

Enabled for `en` only — `rollout_state` in worker/providers/capabilities.py is the gate, not this
file. `model` constructor arg verified directly against the installed livekit-plugins-groq==1.6.5
package (inspect.signature), not assumed from docs: real keyword-only param, defaults to
"llama-3.3-70b-versatile", which is a real, current model per the package's own `models.py`.
Installing this package also pulls in livekit-plugins-openai as a real dependency — Groq's plugin
is built on the OpenAI-compatible interface (base_url defaults to
"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"), not a bespoke Groq wire protocol.

Requires GROQ_API_KEY (env var, or api_key= kwarg) — the plugin itself raises a clear ValueError
if neither is set, checked eagerly at construction (same pattern as every other provider adapter
in this repo).

Groq must never be selectable for `ur` (guide's explicit rule) — enforced structurally in
worker/providers/capabilities.py by Groq's absence from `ur`'s llm dict entirely, not by any
check in this file.
